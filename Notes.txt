1. First started by importing the structure of the tables, then the data from the link.
- Ran the necessary files inside workbench (using root account).
- Gave the privileges to khairultest

2. Started on the models (properties and Populate method), then the necessary repo methods.

3. Then did the necessary service methods.

4. Then started on the REST Controllers.

Important things to note:
- Always need to have the Populate()
- Always need to have the toJson methods
- Date formatting is quite troublesome, need to be familiar with it.
    - Can look at the date format given from the SQL -> then work from there. 
    - For this workshop, order requests won't work properly, since the datetime is weird. (customer id 4).


Continued Workshop 23 on this repository too.
Tables needed:
- order-details
- orders
- products
